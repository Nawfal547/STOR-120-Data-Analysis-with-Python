    "**Question 1.** [Pass the Pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs) is a dice game using asymmetrical throwing dice (shaped like pigs). Each turn involves one player throwing two model pigs, each of which has a dot on one side. The player gains or loses points based on the way the pigs land. Each turn lasts until the player throwing either rolls the pigs in a way that wipes out their current turn score, wipes out their total game score, or decides to stop their turn, add their turn score to their total score and pass the pigs to the next player. The winner is the first player to reach a predetermined total score. When rolling one pig there are six outcomes with the following (approximate) probabilities:\n",

    "Basketball teams would like to hire players who perform well but don't command high salaries.  From this perspective, a very crude measure of a player's *value* to their team is the number of 3 pointers and free throws the player scored in a season for every **\\$100000 of salary** (*Note*: the `Salary` column is in dollars, not hundreds of thousands of dollars). For example, Al Horford scored an average of 5.2 points for 3 pointers and free throws combined, and has a salary of **\\$28 million.** This is equivalent to 280 hundreds of thousands of dollars, so his value is $\\frac{5.2}{280}$. The formula is:\n",
